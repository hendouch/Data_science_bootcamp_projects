Yeah, yeah, we gonna go up

Tanging liwanag ang nakikita
Sa tuwing ipipikit aking mata
Bituin ko'y lalong nagniningning sa dilim
Walang makakapigil

Ito'ng aking pinapangako, hinding-hindi susuko
Kahit pa 'ko'y mabigo, yeah, make me
You know, I'm ready (ready)
Come on and test me

Yeah, we gonna go up
Ibibigay ko ang aking puso
Sa pag-abot ng pangarap, 'di hihinto
Handa akong harapin ang lahat, yeah
Kahit pa imposible

Yeah, we gonna go up (We go up)
Yeah, yeah, we gonna go up (We go up)
Kahit ilang beses pang matumba
Yeah, we gonna go up

Nangarap nang bukas mga mata, yeah
Lumakad nang may bubog sa paa, yeah
Lahat ng 'yong pagdududa
Pakpak ko parang kay Garuda
'Cause I'm gonna go up

Naglaho na'ng takot sa puso, pagkabigo'y malabo
Tagumpay nasa dugo, ako'y positibo
You know, I'm ready (ready)
Come on and test me

Yeah, we gonna go up
Ibibigay ko ang aking puso
Sa pag-abot ng pangarap, 'di hihinto
Handa akong harapin ang lahat, yeah
Kahit pa imposible
Yeah, we gonna go up

Kahit ano'ng mangyari, ako ay tatakbo
Patungo sa liwanag na tanging ninanais ko
Bawat sandali, turing ko ay parang huli, yeah, yeah (uh)

Itong galawang saliwa sa ilog na brr-rumaragasa, uh
'Di ko na kailangan bumangga
Tutal naman kayo'y diretso pababa na
Delikado sa entablado
90 porsyentonbl bigay, desperado, uh
Yeah, we goin' nowhere but up
Nowhere but up

Ibibigay ko ang aking puso
Sa pag-abot ng pangarap, 'di hihinto
Handa akong harapin ang lahat, yeah
Wala nang imposible

Yeah, we gonna go up (We go up) 
Yeah, yeah, we gonna go up (We go up)

6,Love Goes,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/2264939/SB19/Love+Goes,"We don't ever want to say goodbye
Love goes, love goes, love goes (love goes)
There's no answer to the question, ""Why?""
Love goes, love goes, love goes

Yeah, uh-uh, oh

I've been to many places
And everywhere I go I could see all the traces
The happiness written in both of our faces
Forced to embrace the fact
That reality made this erases

And I hate this
Oh, God, I hate this
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is your face
I miss your kiss
The warmth I'm in bliss
I feel the pain and it's insane
Help me, won't you take this?

Ever since my love has gone away (away), away (away)
Every single thing has turned to gray
Still, I don't wanna say goodbye

'Cause I could still feel you
You took my heart with you
No, I can't live without you
All I need is your love
So, won't you take me with you?
'Cause I don't know what to do
You're the one I love
The only one I'll never say goodbye

Oh-oh
Oh-oh, woah
Oh, woah

I don't even have to wait 'til the sun hides
'Cause the brightest stars are the ones
That live in your eyes, but love dies
With hope, I look up to the sky
With both my knees on the ground
I keep on asking, ""Why?""

Why did she have to leave, the only one that I love?
I hope right now He's listening, the Man up above
'Cause I'll never get better
I will love her forever
No one's gonna be eno-o-o-ough

Oh, how could you leave me here?
No way (no way), no way (no way)
I'll take the pain, but I'll never say
I'll never ever say goodbye

'Cause I could still feel you
You took my heart with you
No, I can't live without you
All I need is your love
So, won't you take me with you?
'Cause I don't know what to do
You're the one I love
The only one I'll never say goodbye

No, this can't be true
Why did I lose you?
I keep loving you
I don't want to say goodbye
Never say goodbye

'Cause I could still feel you (oh, woah)
You took my heart with you
No, I can't live without you
All I need is your love (need your love)
So, won't you take me with you? (with you)
'Cause I don't know what to do (with you)

'Di na dapat tumitig pa sa 'yong mga mata

Kaibigan
Kaya mo yan
Kaibigan
All right!

'Wag mong ikunot ang iyong noo
Nariyan ang kaibigan mo (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Upang samahan ka sa malungkot
Na panahon at masiyahan (all right, all right, all right)
Tumingin ka sa paligid mo
Kaming lahat nandirito (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Hinding-hindi ka na mag-iisa
Kami ay kaibigan mo

Mahirap man ang daan na ating tatahakin
Minsan, tayo rin naman ang mayro'ng pagkukulang (all right, oh)
Pero kung lahat tayo'y sama-sama, walang hahadlang
Lahat tayo'y maghawak-kamay
At one (one), two (two), one, two, three, four

'Wag mong ikunot ang iyong noo

Kaming lahat nandirito (ay, yay, yay, yay, yay)
Hinding-hindi ka na mag-iisa
Kami ay kaibigan mo (all right)

Mahirap man, 'wag mong isipin
Nandito'ng SB19
Problema'y kakayanin
Kasama'ng SB19
Ating aabutin
Bituing nagniningning
Buhay ay gaganda
Kasama mo ang SB19

Mahirap man ang daan na ating tatahakin
Minsan, tayo rin naman ang mayro'ng pagkukulang (all right, oh)

Yo 나는 누구인가 평생 물어온 질문
아마 평생 정답은 찾지 못할 그 질문
나란 놈을 고작 말 몇 개로 답할 수 있었다면
신께서 그 수많은 아름다움을 다 만드시진 않았겠지
How you feel? 지금 기분이 어때
사실 난 너무 좋아 근데 조금 불편해
나는 내가 개인지 돼진지 뭔지도 아직 잘 모르겠는데
남들이 와서 진주목걸일 거네
칵 퉤

예전보단 자주 웃어
소원했던 Superhero
이젠 진짜 된 것 같어 
근데 갈수록 뭔 말들이 많어
누군 달리라고 누군 멈춰서라 해
얘는 숲을 보라고 걔는 들꽃을 보라 해
내 그림자, 나는 망설임이라 쓰고 불렀네
걘 그게 되고 나서 망설인 적이 없었네
무대 아래든 아님 조명 아래든 자꾸 나타나
아지랑이처럼 뜨겁게 자꾸 날 노려보네 (oh shit)

야 이 짓을 왜 시작한 건지 벌써 잊었냐
넌 그냥 들어주는 누가 있단 게 막 좋았던 거야
가끔은 그냥 싹 다 헛소리 같아
취하면 나오는 거 알지 huh 치기 같아
나 따위가 무슨 music
나 따위가 무슨 truth
나 따위가 무슨 소명
나 따위가 무슨 muse
내가 아는 나의 흠 어쩜 그게 사실 내 전부
세상은 사실 아무 관심 없어, 나의 서툼
이제 질리지도 않는 후회들과
매일 밤 징그럽게 뒹굴고
돌릴 길 없는 시간들을 습관처럼 비틀어도
그때마다 날 또 일으켜 세운 것
최초의 질문
내 이름 석 자
그 가장 앞에 와야 할 but

So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Oh do you wanna go (go)?
Do you wanna fly (fly)? 
Where's your soul? where's your dream?
Do you think you're alive?

Oh shit
I don't know man
But I know one thing

Yeah my name is R
내가 기억하고 사람들이 아는 나
날 토로하기 위해 내가 스스로 만들어낸 나
Yeah 난 날 속여왔을지도 
뻥쳐왔을지도
But 부끄럽지 않아 이게 내 영혼의 지도
Dear myself 넌 절대로 너의 온도를 잃지 마
따뜻히도 차갑게도 될 필요 없으니까

내가 되고 싶은 나
사람들이 원하는 나
니가 사랑하는 나
또 내가 빚어내는 나
웃고 있는 나
가끔은 울고 있는 나

Kiss me on the lips lips 二人の秘密
捕まるよう 毒される君に
君以外じゃもう従いきれない

서롤 불러왔던 것처럼
내 혈관 속 DNA가 말해줘
내가 찾아 헤매던 너라는 걸

우리 만남은 수학의 공식
종교의 율법 우주의 섭리
내게 주어진 운명의 증거, 너는 내 꿈의 출처
Take it, take it 너에게 내민 내 손은 정해진 숙명

좀 더 세게 날 이끄네

우리만이 true lovers (lovers)

그녀를 볼 때마다 소스라치게 놀라
신기하게 자꾸만 숨이 멎는 게 참 이상해 설마
이런 게 말로만 듣던 사랑이란 감정일까

이렇게 말하니까 더
보고 싶다
너희 사진을 보고 있어도
보고 싶다
너무 야속한 시간
나는 우리가 밉다
이젠 얼굴 한 번 보는 것도
힘들어진 우리가
여긴 온통 겨울 뿐이야
8월에도 겨울이 와
마음은 시간을 달려가네
홀로 남은 설국열차
니 손 잡고
지구 반대편까지 가
겨울을 끝내고파
그리움들이 얼마나 눈처럼 내려야
그 봄날이 올까
Friend

허공을 떠도는 작은 먼지처럼
작은 먼지처럼
날리는 눈이 나라면
조금 더 빨리 네게
닿을 수 있을 텐데

눈꽃이 떨어져요
또 조금씩 멀어져요
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
얼마나 기다려야
또 몇 밤을 더 새워야
널 보게 될까 (널 보게 될까)
만나게 될까 (만나게 될까)

추운 겨울 끝을 지나
다시 봄날이 올 때까지
꽃 피울 때까지
그곳에 좀 더 머물러줘
머물러줘

니가 변한 건지
(니가 변한 건지)
아니면 내가 변한 건지
(내가 변한 건지)
이 순간 흐르는 시간조차 미워
우리가 변한 거지 뭐
모두가 그런 거지 뭐

그래 밉다 니가
넌 떠났지만
단 하루도 너를
잊은 적이 없었지 난
솔직히 보고 싶은데
이만 너를 지울게
그게 널 원망하기보단 덜 아프니까

시린 널 불어내 본다
연기처럼 하얀 연기처럼
말로는 지운다 해도
사실 난 아직 널 보내지 못하는데

눈꽃이 떨어져요
또 조금씩 멀어져요
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
얼마나 기다려야
또 몇 밤을 더 새워야
널 보게 될까 (널 보게 될까)
만나게 될까 (만나게 될까)

You know it all
You’re my best friend
아침은 다시 올 거야
어떤 어둠도 어떤 계절도
영원할 순 없으니까

벚꽃이 피나봐요
이 겨울도 끝이 나요
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
보고 싶다 (보고 싶다)
조금만 기다리면
며칠 밤만 더 새우면
만나러 갈게 (만나러 갈게)
데리러 갈게 (데리러 갈게)

피어있는 이 garden
가시투성이 umm
이 모래성에 난 날 매었어

너의 이름은 뭔지
갈 곳이 있긴 한지
Oh could you tell me? ehh
이 정원에 숨어든 널 봤어

And I know
너의 온긴 모두 다 진짜란 걸 푸른 꽃을 꺾는 손
잡고 싶지만

내 운명인 걸
Don't smile on me
Light on me
너에게 다가설 수 없으니까
내겐 불러줄 이름이 없어

You know that I can't
Show you me
Give you me
초라한 모습 보여줄 순 없어
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가
But I still want you (want you, want you)

외로움의 정원에 핀 너를 닮은 꽃
주고 싶었지 ooh hoo hoo
바보 같은 가면을 벗고서

But I know 영원히 그럴 수는 없는 걸 숨어야만 하는 걸
추한 나니까

난 두려운 걸
초라해
I’m so afraid
결국엔 너도 날 또 떠나버릴까
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가

할 수 있는 건
정원에
이 세상에
예쁜 너를 닮은 꽃을 피운 다음
니가 아는 나로 숨쉬는 것
But I still want you
Ah, ah
I still want you, ah

어쩌면 그때
조금만
이만큼만
용길 내서 너의 앞에 섰더라면
지금 모든 건 달라졌을까

난 울고 있어
사라진
무너진
홀로 남겨진 이 모래성에서
부서진 가면을 바라보면서
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
And I still want you",BTS

Eh yeah yeah yeah burn it
타버린 재마저 남지 않게

Ah 이게 진짜 너고 이게 진짜 나야
이젠 끝을 봤고 원망도 안 남아
달던 꿈은 깼고 나는 눈을 감아
이게 진짜 너고 이게 진짜 나야

같은 곳을 향해 걸었었는데 (aye aye)
이 곳이 우리의 마지막이 돼
영원을 말하던 우리였는데
가차없이 서로를 부수네
같은 꿈을 꿨다 생각했는데
그 꿈은 비로소 꿈이 되었네
심장이 찢겨져 차라리 불 태워줘
고통과 미련 그 무엇도 남지 않게끔

Oh, you're my tear
You're my, you're my tear
You're my tear
You're my, you're my tear
You're my fear
You're my, you're my fear
What more can I say?
You're my

어떤 말을 해야 할지
우리는 알고 있지
정답은 정해 있는데
늘 대답은 어렵지

왜 흘리는지
왜 찢어버리는지
소용없어 내게는
이별은 내겐 그 순간들뿐 (flashback)
네 입에서 말을 하는 순간
우리의 초점이 불규칙해지는 순간
모든 게 위험한 순간에 두 글자가 준 우리의 끝
안 울 걸걸걸 안 찢을 걸걸걸
그런 말은 못 한다고 앞으로 나도
이별 불치병
넌 내 시작과 끝 that is all
나의 만남과 나의 이별
전부였어 앞으로 가 fear
반복될 거야 너로 인한 tear

어릴 적 집 안의 구석
한 켠에 자리잡은 갈색 piano
그때 기억해
내 키보다 훨씬 더 컸던
갈색 piano 그게 날 이끌 때
널 우러러보며
동경했었네
작은 손가락으로 널 어루만질 때
“I feel so nice, mom I feel so nice”
그저 손 가던 대로 거닐던 건반
그땐 너의 의미를 몰랐었네
바라보기만 해도 좋았던 그때

그때 기억해
초등학교 무렵
내 키가 너의 키보다 더 커졌던 그때
그토록 동경했던 널 등한시하며
백옥 같던 건반 그 위 먼지가 쌓여가며
방치됐던 니 모습
그때도 몰랐었지
너의 의미 내가 어디 있든 항상 넌 그 자릴
지켰으니 그런데
그게 마지막이 될 줄 몰랐네

내게 미안해 하지마
어떤 형태로든 날 다시 만나게 될 거야
그때 반갑게 다시 맞아줘”

그때 기억해
까맣게 잊고 있었던
널 다시 마주했던 때 14살 무렵
어색도 잠시 다시 널 어루만졌지
긴 시간 떠나있어도 절대 거부감 없이
날 받아줬던 너
Without you, I'm nothing
새벽을 지나서 둘이서 함께 맞는 아침
영원히 너는 나의 손을 놓지마
나도 다시 널 놓지 않을 테니까

그때 기억해
나의 십대의 마지막을
함께 불태웠던 너 그래 한 치 앞도
뵈지 않던 그때 울고, 웃고
너와 함께여서 그 순간조차
이제는 추억으로
박살난 어깰 부여잡고 말했지
나 더 이상은 진짜 못하겠다고
포기하고 싶던 그때마다
곁에서 넌 말했지
새꺄 너는 진짜 할 수 있다고
그래 그래
그때 기억해
지치고 방황했었던
절망의 깊은 수렁에
빠졌던 그때 내가 널 밀어내고
널 만난 걸 원망해도
넌 꿋꿋이 내 곁을 지켰지 말 안 해도
그러니 절대
너는 내 손을 놓지마
두 번 다시 내가 널 놓지 않을 테니까
나의 탄생 그리고 내 삶의 끝
그 모든 걸 지켜볼 너일 테니까

우리 옷깃을 스치면 인연이 될까
아니 우리 전생에 스쳤을지 몰라
어쩜 수없이 부딪혔을지도 몰라

어둠 속에서 사람들은
낮보다 행복해 보이네
다들 자기가 있을 곳을 아는데
나만 하릴없이 걷네
그래도 여기 섞여있는 게 더 편해
밤을 삼킨 뚝섬은 나에게
전혀 다른 세상을 건네
나는 자유롭고 싶다
자유에게서 자유롭고 싶다
지금은 행복한데 불행하니까
나는 나를 보네
뚝섬에서, yeah

아랑곳하지 않고
띄워주신 꿈의 조각배

펼쳐 있는 지름길 아닌
빚을 쥔 이 꿈의 길

목소리는 선명하고
기억나는 건
그때 엄마의 강인함이 내겐 변화구

꼭 성공해야겠다고 결심하고
그 다짐 하나로

127,Lost,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33395920/BTS/Lost,"눈을 감고 아직 여기 서 있어
사막과 바다 가운데 길을 잃고서
여전히 헤매고 있어
어디로 가야 할지 yeah
이리도 많을 줄 몰랐어
가지 못한 길도 갈 수 없는 길도
I never felt this way before
어른이 되려는지

난 너무 어려운 걸
이 길이 맞는지
정말 너무 혼란스러
Never leave me alone
그래도 믿고 있어 믿기지 않지만
길을 잃는단 건
그 길을 찾는 방법

Lost my way
쉴 새 없이 몰아치는 거친 비바람 속에
Lost my way
출구라곤 없는 복잡한 세상 속에
Lost my way
Lost my way
수없이 헤매도 난 나의 길을 믿어볼래

Lost my way
Found my way
Lost my way
Found my way

어디로 가는 개미를 본 적 있어
단 한 번에 길을 찾는 법이 없어
수없이 부딪히며 기어가는
먹일 찾기 위해 며칠이고 방황하는
You know
쓸모 있어 이 좌절도
난 믿어 우린 바로 가고 있어
언젠가 우리가 찾게 되면
분명 한 번에 집으로 와 개미처럼

아직은 어려운 걸
이 길이 맞는지
정말 너무 혼란스러
Don’t you leave me alone
그래도 믿고 싶어 믿기지 않지만
길을 잃는단 건
그 길을 찾는 방법

Lost my way
쉴 새 없이 몰아치는 거친 비바람 속에
Lost my way
출구라곤 없는 복잡한 세상 속에
Lost my way
Lost my way
수없이 헤매도 난 나의 길을 믿어볼래

So long
기약 없는 희망이여 이젠 안녕
So long
좀 느려도 내 발로 걷겠어
이 길이 분명 나의 길이니까
돌아가도 언젠가 닿을 테니까
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream

Lost my way
쉴 새 없이 몰아치는 거친 비바람 속에
Lost my way
출구라곤 없는 복잡한 세상 속에
Lost my way
Lost my way

(Put your hands into the sky!)
(If you're feeling the vibe!)
(If you're ready to fly!)

어릴 적의 날 기억해
큰 걱정이 없었기에
이 작은 깃털이 날개가 될 것이고
그 날개로 날아보게 해줄 거란
믿음, 신념 가득 차 있었어
웃음소리와 함께

가지 말라는 길을 가고
하지 말라는 일을 하고
원해선 안 될 걸 원하고
또 상처받고, 상처받고
You can call me stupid
그럼 난 그냥 씩 하고 웃지
난 내가 하기 싫은 일로
성공하긴 싫어
난 날 밀어
Word

난 날 믿어 내 등이 아픈 건
날개가 돋기 위함인 걸
날 널 믿어 지금은 미약할지언정
끝은 창대한 비약일 걸
Fly, fly up in the sky
Fly, fly get ’em up high
니가 택한 길이야 새꺄 쫄지 말어
이제 고작 첫 비행인 걸 uh

Take me to the sky
훨훨 날아갈 수 있다면
영영 달아날 수 있다면
If my wings could fly
점점 무거워지는 공기를 뚫고 날아

날아 나 날아 난 날아가
Higher than higher than
Higher than the sky
날아 나 날아 난 날아가
붉게 물든 날개를 힘껏

Spread spread spread my wings
Spread spread spread my wings
Wings are made to fly fly fly
Fly fly fly

어쩌면 나는 너의 진실이자 거짓일지 몰라
어쩌면 당신의 사랑이자 증오
어쩌면 나는 너의 원수이자 벗
당신의 천국이자 지옥 때론 자랑이자 수모
난 절대 가면을 벗지 못해
이 가면 속의 난 니가 아는 걔가 아니기에
오늘도 make up to wake up and dress up to mask on
당신이 사랑하는 내가 되기 위해
당신이 사랑하는 걔가 되기 위해서
그 좋아하던 
도 끊었지 그저 당신을 위해서
싫어하는 옷도 과도한 메이크업도
당신의 웃음과 행복이 곧 내 행복의 척도
이런 내가 이런 내가 당신의 사랑 받을 자격 있을까
언제나 당신의 최고가 되기 위해 노력을 해

가장 빛나야 할 시간에 난 mask off
Lost star 내 짐을 내려놔 어둠을 즐겨
죽일 듯이 쏴대는 조명도 없으니 ye
그저 맘 가는 대로
감 닿는 대로, 날 안 잡는 대로
Tick tock, the dark is over
다시 너의 최고가 되기 위해
내 자신을 붙잡어
사랑은 사람을 미치게 해
그래 미친놈의 각오

전부인 너를 위해 내가 내린 해답을 줘
그걸 사랑해주는 너

So f*ck being tame, I'd rather be wild
Bitches is Brandy, they wanna be down
Soon as these bitches got something to sell
They say my name, say my name, Destiny Child
Everybody wanna be lit, everybody wanna be rich
Everybody wanna be this, if I was you, I'd hate me bitch
Read my rhymes, nigga, suck my dick
All of that talk and I'm calling it out
Public opinions from private accounts

Bitches is mad, bitches is trash (Errr)

Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (ayy)
And you a boss, so you hate when niggas waste time (ayy)
You too pretty to be paused on the FaceTime (ayy)
Damn, I'm just statin' the facts
You hate that like you hate when niggas tell you, ""relax""
(What the f*ck you mean, ""relax""?)
You want somethin' more than just physical (word)
It's been a while since you met someone original (word)
You spend your time drinkin' wine in your livin' room

You see me, see the squad, issa gang (issa gang)
You see him, issa bum, issa lame (issa lame)
But issa difference 'tween me and what's-his-name (ayy)

Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, how they hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (see who winnin'), we see who got it (see who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (cash)

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
F*ck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Whose feelings that you hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a f*ck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?

Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""f*ck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got it in shows
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunt on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer

So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?)

Beast, mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah)

Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced)

Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at

Be careful, be careful, be careful with me
Yeah, look

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
F*ck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a f*ck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it

You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""#CardiBIsSoProblematic"" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad

You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly
She count money in her sleep and she don't never spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin' shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life
And that guap look like Iyanla 'cause that bag just changed my life
Hey, y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne
But can we please get some more champagne?
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy

I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

Call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And f*ck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Little bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
(You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping)
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh

All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, ""Resentment"" on repeat
I'ma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbing you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ay, these heels are Givenchy, hoe
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)

Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spent what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies
Don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum

I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a f*ck

Dropped two mixtapes in six months

He buy me Yves Saint Laurent

I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills

My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that li'l bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they niggas is safe

I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like frosted flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott

No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know

Ayo, step up in the spot, you know who I be
Couple bottles pop in the VIP
Dancin' all up on the couch, shakin' my ass
Probably leave with ya man, grand larceny
Bitch, pardon me, you don't wanna start with me
I be out here gettin' cash, you be in the thottery
I be in the trap, chasin' chips like the lottery
You ain't bout that life, you don't be like Cardi B
All my gettin'-shmoney hoes, put ya hands up
Yeah, you cute but you gon' have to pull ya pants up, yeah
I see you over there checkin' out my thick thighs, tetas
See, I gotta smart mouth and what?
Keep it litty for my city, NYC
Take the whole nut, ain't worried 'bout no Plan B
Yeah, I'm nasty, lick my lips, blow a kiss
And walk off with a hunnid thou' on my wrist
Swish, I ain't with the politics
""A hoe never gets cold,"" you know what the motto is
Unless it's baguettes, diamond cuts, gold bottles, bitch
Sittin' in that 6, frostbit, feelin' hella lit

Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit

NY, do or die, yo, I got this
KSR, chill y'all, yo I got this
Forty-deuce, two-seater in the cockpit
And I'm a freak, so you know that bitch topless
You a hot mess, that's a fact though
Undisputed live, bitch, you know how that go
A lot of thots out here plottin' on my cash flow
But I'm a queen just tryna build the castle
You a fiend, you all up in my asshole
I cause a scene and give you what you ask for
Hair did, manicure, so ready, check
Attitude have to be so petty, yep
I'm in it this year, a minute to spare, I swear
My vision is clear, y'all bitches be weird, I'm here
Showstopper, Ms. Life of the party, yeah
Top shotta, no filter, Young Cardi, yeah

Watch when I start askin' you
Why the f*ck you take so long to answer my message?

Oh, you with the homies?
Don't even think you can curve me for some other pussy

I see the pain in your eyes
And truth is, only the strong survive
And you still here, so from here you only gon' rise
Spread them wings so they can tell you how far you gonna fly
You don't gotta pop them pills
I know just how you feel
I know there's a lot of fake love
But there's love that's actually real
But that can't stop you now
You're already on the battle field
Took everythin' that came your way
Almost at the top of the hill, fly, baby, fly

Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

Don't be so quick to just give in
If you give up now, how you gon' win?
I know them stressful nights made you and the pills best friends
I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end
I'm countin' on you, boo
Put this peer pressure on you
If I overcame that shit
I know you can make it, too
I don't want to see you lose
There's other ways to heal that bruise
I know you can make it to see
What's at the end of the solution, shine, baby, shine

Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up (never give up)

Don't jump now (never give up)
I'll come for you (never give up)
I'm here for you

Tú no quieres saber na' de mí (uhh, nana)
Dime qu[e fue lo que yo hice mal (dime qué pasó)
Te pusieron en contra de mí (uhh, nana)
Pero es peor pedir perdón que perdonar

Se murió una flor y cambió de color (yeh-ieh)
Tú eras mi diabla, yo te daba calor
Fumando pa' olvidarte, pa' matar el dolor
Y a veces quiero morirme, pero nadie ha muerto de amor

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no, no, no, no, no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (leggo')

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no, no, no, no, no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cuando lo hacíamos
Cuando en la cama nos matábamos

Te dejaste manipular, tú no sabes amar
Tú dices que tú me odias, pero tú no me va' olvidar
Sabes que tus piernas, yo te las pongo a temblar
Yo te devoraba, y tú empezaba' a gritar

Si se mueren, en la muerte traicionan, 
te aman, se van y te odian
Y en la muerte es como la personas que te dejan sola después que te lloran
Hablando con la luna, como un lobo buscando a su loba
Buscando al demonio que te está devorando en su alcoba

Hablándote mal de mí
Como si yo ya me morí
Dile a ese infeliz que te la coma como yo te la comí
Y que te haga mojarte como yo te hice venirte
Tú dijiste que encima 'e mi cuerpo tú más, tú querías morirte, yeh

Sólo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decías nada, nada, no, no

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
""Ya no, no te conozco"", ""hoy 'ta to' bien""
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver

Solita yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver
Porque dicen y yo creo que es Lucifer en mujer

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no, no, no, no, no
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

You ain't cherish shit when you had it
Turn me back to a savage
Grab your stuff while you at it
Now my heart as cold as my Patek, uh

Man, I guess you've been away now
See me on the way up, you on your way down
You had you a ten, but now you a dub
You ain't here, but you wishing you was
You gon' miss grabbing this ass
Now you can miss me with them subs
You don't gotta check on me 'cause I got a check on me
I don't need nothing from nobody, not you especially

And you know that I'm the baddest, Cartier glasses, Fendi fabric
And I'm years away from basic, and I'm miles away from average
But, one thing ain't adding up to me
How you gon' mess with a bitch that look up to me, off

I cannot let up (let up)
Hungry like a Gucci sweater (sweater)
Ain't nobody drippin' wetter (drippin')
I took the time to write a letter (I took the time)
We worked hard out the ghetto
I don't deserve your heart, know you fed up (nah)
We both had a broken heart when we met up
Your body a piece of art, you don't sell it

You know that I miss it, I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone, lookin' how we would kick it (kick it)
Knock at the door, it's a visit
She take that shit off then I f*ck in the kitchen (smash)
His and hers, Mr. and Mrs. (hey)
When I talk to her baby girl listens (listen)
I had a dream and you was in it (dream)
When you gone, I feel like I been sinnin'

Come back, come back, come back (come back)
You not really rich, got the bomb pack (bomb)
Dive in the water, have fun with that (dive)
I might put a daughter or son in that (I might)
I bought you a ring and five hundred racks (hey)
She like the triangle Balenci bag (drip)
You know you an angel, come save the bad (angel)
If you really love me then take me back (J Balvin, men)

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
""Ya no, no te conozco"", ""pues 'ta to' bien""
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver

Los dos, sólita yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver
Porque dicen y yo creo que es Lucifer en mujer

Fly to Dubai, in a yacht you could blow me
Dinner at Philippe, but I really want a Philippe
Gonna have to step your game up

Whippin' the foreign, I'm bendin' these streets
Woo! Woo! Look at my piece

Scrolling through my feed I saw you just had post a pic
I choose you like a Pokémon
I choose you, you're selection one
I got money, you got money too
So let's go half on rent
When I buy you a new purse it's 'cause you bought my kicks
I move fast like a brand new car
I move fast like a shooting star
If I say we married then goddamn we gettin' married
If you need it and I got it you can have it, bitch, I'm sharing
If you cryin' I'ma ask you why you cryin' bitch I'm caring
If you need me to look out for you I'm posted and I'm staring
Thou should never have another boyfriend, I get jealous
Yeah, I’m all 'bout spreadin' love, but I get crazy as a felon
I choose you, now you have to deal
But you're so cute, you can make me chill

We can really do a little somethin'

I guess my all just wasn't enough
Yeah there's something about you I can't help it
But I'ma do for myself I'm being selfish

Babe your melody is the voice I need makes me skip a beat, yeah
And baby you know it, yeah
But it's hard to show it, yeah
See the one I love used to be in clubs used to f*ck with thugs, yeah
And I can't expose it yeah cause she already know it, yeah
But why don't you ask me?
Why is it so hard to fall in love?
Why don't you ask me?
Why can I never ever ever try?
Why don't you ask me?
Why everything is going in circles?
Why don't you ask me? (I guess we'll never know)
I guess we'll never know
They say the one that you truly love hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold
It's not your fault girl

Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish (I'm so cold girl)
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish (it's not your fault girl)
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish (I'm so cold girl)
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish (it's not your fault girl)

Withering away as I gaze at the sky 
Looking in his face and all the pain he caused me
I ask why
Didn't I love?
Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself?
What do you wish? 
'Cause that part of me no longer exist
This time I'm first, I'm picking me
I finally learned to be selfish",Cardi-B

Some regular degular, bloody bars

I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit and now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the f*ck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutter shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Can't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me, really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time
Pump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, got one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot
So I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest

Uh
I said, woo!

Last year, I thought I would lose it
Reading shit on the internet
My smoothie cleanse and my diet
No, I ain't f*ck Drake yet

Yeah, pop that pussy like you ain't pop that pussy in a while
Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up in church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child (woo)
Gimme some neck, gimme a check
Pussy so good, make a nigga invest
Gimme a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
I'll get it back up, just give me a sec'
Give him some vag', I'm gettin' a bag
Give him some ass, I'm gettin' some Raf

All these verses I done slayed, all these looks that I done gave
Could have let these f*ck hoes drown, but I let them ride my wave

Stop lyin' on the pussy when you know you never ate it (pussy)
Took the wig off and braided back my hair (woo)

And my stock steady risin', you will never get a share (no)

Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer

She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
""Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami""
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (border with me)

Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me

Come south of the border with me, border with me
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me

He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
Said he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

I love his lips 'cause he says the words
""Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami""
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (time in)

Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that
Bed, be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Bed, be free

I like those Balenciagas (those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (cha-ching)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (what?)
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though (sorry)
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah, they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Woo, Facts

Ich mag die Liebe, mag die Stille, mag den Hustle, den wir leben (leben)
Hass' die Falschheit vieler Blender, aber lieb' Ganovenehre (wooh)
Ich mag Leute, die nicht quatschen, sondern lieber stille Wasser
Und statt Gold sammeln wie Inkas lieber 'ne Finca für meinen Vater (ahh)
Meine Gang regiert den Plaza, alle meine Jungs sind on fuego
Was für Hahn im Korb? Ich seh' maximal nur Calimeros
Gangster schweigen und genießen, also quatsch mir nicht, Pendejo
Denn ein Rückgrat ist mehr wert als die Taschen voll Dinero
Geld kommt, Geld geht, aber Familie bleibt
Der innere Kreis elitär und klein
Auch wenn der Teufel viele Gesichter zeigt
Gott sei Dank nicht meins (meins)
Jeder testet, jeder redet, jeder schneidet sich ins Fleisch
Ich halt' meine Leute, halt' meine Ziele, meine Versprechen immer ein (ein)
Courage über Fame (Fame)
Und lieber Wölfe, die noch beißen, als die Köter, die nur bellen
Klasse über Geld
Und lieber Loyalität für meine Gang als den Erfolg nur für mich selbst (selbst, selbst)

Früher ist Papa zur Arbeit mit Tickets gefahren
Heute sitzt Papa im dickesten Wagen
Weil wir bizzy waren, weil wir, weil wir bizzy waren
Meine Devise ist klar, einhundert Riesen in bar

Egal, ob Benza oder Siebener, wir fahren vor
Das ist gangster, unser Leben einfach hardcore
Tatort, fliehen vom Tatort
Tatort, fliehen vom Tatort
Mach' Kilo für Kilo weg, salame, salame
Sie machen Minus jetzt, jealousy, jealousy
Wir sind Jungs, die immer mehr wollen
Rolex am Gelenk, unsere Zeit ist wertvoll
Keine Hunderttausend-Euro-Schecks
Nein, nein, ich will alles bar, bar, bar

280,Bet It,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/39125938/Cardi+B/Bet+It,"Un adiós sin razones
Unos años sin valor
Bardi

Ain't no half-steppin', all I do is break records
Now I play chess so a bitch can't check her
Made it out of hell and it's still gettin' hectic
And my life is a movie, only Cardi could direct it
Only take cash, they ain't never gave credit
Had to risk it all in myself so I bet it
Started on the pole, in the end, don't regret it
They'll use the past against you if you let it
But I'm back and I'm better, got Henny on the line
Tell her that I have real shit on my mind
'Cause the clocks start tickin' from the day I got signed
Million dollar watch 'cause a bitch got time
They'll tell you everything about me, but the grind
Tell you there's a bitch this hot, then they lyin'
If I pay for the streams, why the f*ck you ain't buyin'?
When these hoes start hatin', these hoes start lyin'

Años sin valor

I got dressed for the stages, got dressed for the court
Dressed for my husband, told him, ""Rip this shit off""
Got dressed for the GRAMMYs, then I left with awards
Hundred thousand dollars dress left on the floor
They was losin' they mind when I hit the Met Gala
Tail so long, it dragged thirty minutes after
After the tears, you can get to the laughter
After the bookings, on to the next chapter
Got goals that I want, got goals that I met
Gold on my neck that I froze in baguettes
More movie sets mean more movie checks
'Cause I live in a mansion, I don't live in regrets
Plans for the fam, got Kulture the jet
Told us to invest, so the culture is set
Blam-blam-blam, if you posin' a threat
Never did it for clout, never talked on the set, bitch

Años sin valor

Uh
Who they all come get when they want shit chartin'?
They was hittin' me when they wanna break artist
After we break bread, then we get shit started
Obviously they don' want it, unless Cardi B on it
Then I want some shit, 'cause I done some shit
Checks on like I just won some shit
Shoot up the charge like I done some shit
Gotta read my deal, 'cause I run this shit
All the dope boys runnin' all the Wallstreet dudes
Chefs in the mansion 'cause I don't even buy food
You should laugh, I'ma rap, sayin' I will get booed
Now I get a big bag, that's a big move
From the Bronx to the 'burbs, make big moves
Rock red bottoms, made 'em big shoes
Play goose, and I'm so focused
'Cause the money never made me bein' broke dead, bitch

Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
Oh, I
Tell me what's changed, is it my status? Is it my fame?
Is it my pockets? Is it my change?
Is it my pride? Is it my body?
Back then, ""no show, no call"" was your motto
Only hit me up after the club and you off that bottle
Pussy so good you thought you hit the lotto

I've been in the bamboo, yeah
Focused on this music
My ex nigga, he blew it

Last year, I thought I would lose it
Reading shit on the internet
My smoothie cleanse and my diet
No, I ain't f*ck Drake yet

Spending all your time tryna break a woman down
Realer shit is going on, baby, take a look around
If you thought that I was ratchet with my ass hanging out
Just wait until the summer when they let me out the house, bitch

(Talk and talk and talk and)
(Give 'em somethin' to talk about)

Sick of rumors
But hater's do what they do (uh)

Y'all be runnin' with fake news, yeah

Cardi ain't poppin', no, that's a machine (huh?)
Nobody listen', they buyin' them streams (hmm)
They even post it on blogs overseas
A lie in a language I can't even read
The f*ck does this mean?

Look, I'm a Bronx bitch with some pop hits
Used to pop off when they pop shit (woo)
But I'm calmed down and I'm locked in
And my records live in the top ten

Lizzo, teach me about big girl coochie (okay)
Last time I got freaky, the FCC sued me
But I'mma keep doing what I wanna do
'Cause all the rumors are, all the rumors are true, yeah

They hated on me since school, yeah
I never thought I was cool, yeah
Now me and Cardi, we cool, yeah

I love hoes on poles, yeah (woo)
I am body goals, yeah
This shit from my soul, yeah
Black people made rock and roll, yeah

While you're spending all your time tryna break a woman down
Realer shit is going on, baby, take a look around
If you thought that I was ratchet with my ass hanging out
Just wait until the summer when they let me out the house, bitch

Once upon a time man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch, who nigga wanna f*ck on me
I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga

I could make the party hot
I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fucking with me
Chances are they probably not
If I had a dick you probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speaking Capanese hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever popping shit
Pulling up and dropping shit
Gotta argue with him, 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playing gotta make him understand
If ain't no ring on my finger you ain't going on my 'Gram

Bitches ain't fucking with me now and I can see why
Dirty ass, dusty ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch ""That bad breath smell like horse sex""
Put it on him now, he will never be the same
Tatted on my ass cause I really like the pain
He nutted on my butt, I said ""I'm glad that you came""
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train

I don't know, I don't care, it's not my business, but if it is true
Don't let bitches, like, make-
Don't let them feel like they have a one-up by destroying your moment
By fucking telling your business to the world
On some, ""Haha, yeah, I'ma do it on purpose, I'ma do it spitefully""
Do it your own way and do it beautifully, do it special
If you are pregnant and everything, say it in a beautiful way in your music
Say why you, you know, decided to be with your nigga
Even though y'all have problems, put that drama in your music, yeah
'Cause if bitches wanna get clout off you, you gon' get clout off them
And you gonna put that shit in your music
Say some shit like, ""I got my own fuckin' money""
Make them bitches feel hurt, hit them bitches where it hurt
And put that shit in your music and make money off it in your music

Unos años sin valor
Bardi

Ain't no half-steppin', all I do is break records
Now I play chess so a bitch can't check her
Made it out of hell and it's still gettin' hectic
And my life is a movie, only Cardi could direct it
Only take cash, they ain't never gave credit
Had to risk it all in myself so I bet it
Started on the pole, in the end, don't regret it
They'll use the past against you if you let it
But I'm back and I'm better, got Henny on the line
Tell her that I have real shit on my mind
'Cause the clocks start tickin' from the day I got signed
Million dollar watch 'cause a bitch got time
They'll tell you everything about me, but the grind
Tell you there's a bitch this hot, then they lyin'
If I pay for the streams, why the f*ck you ain't buyin'?
When these hoes start hatin', these hoes start lyin'

Años sin valor

I got dressed for the stages, got dressed for the court
Dressed for my husband, told him, ""Rip this shit off""
Got dressed for the GRAMMYs, then I left with awards
Hundred thousand dollars dress left on the floor
They was losin' they mind when I hit the Met Gala
Tail so long, it dragged thirty minutes after
After the tears, you can get to the laughter
After the bookings, on to the next chapter
Got goals that I want, got goals that I met
Gold on my neck that I froze in baguettes
More movie sets mean more movie checks
'Cause I live in a mansion, I don't live in regrets
Plans for the fam, got Kulture the jet
Told us to invest, so the culture is set
Blam-blam-blam, if you posin' a threat
Never did it for clout, never talked on the set, bitch

Años sin valor

Uh
Who they all come get when they want shit chartin'?
They was hittin' me when they wanna break artist
After we break bread, then we get shit started
Obviously they don' want it, unless Cardi B on it
Then I want some shit, 'cause I done some shit
Checks on like I just won some shit
Shoot up the charge like I done some shit
Gotta read my deal, 'cause I run this shit
All the dope boys runnin' all the Wallstreet dudes
Chefs in the mansion 'cause I don't even buy food
You should laugh, I'ma rap, sayin' I will get booed
Now I get a big bag, that's a big move
From the Bronx to the 'burbs, make big moves
Rock red bottoms, made 'em big shoes
Play goose, and I'm so focused
'Cause the money never made me bein' broke dead, bitch

That's why I'm workin' and I'm in the Benz 'cause you in the bed
Bitches is sleepin', f*ck is they thinkin'? What is you doin'?
Then they be mad, lookin' at me like I did something to 'em, uh
Bank account on racks, pussy still on drip drop
Put this pussy on wax, took me straight to the tip top
I might race with the Wraith, ain't no space in the safe
Next bitch in my face catchin' case, catchin' case
But anywho, anywho, Birkin bag, Jimmy Choos
All my bitches say ""Eeeeooowwww!"", all my guns go ""Boom!""
More guns than the warden, smack hoes with my Jordans
Pussy's floodin' New Orleans, kiss a bitch and I'm gorgeous
Never been no pussy, yo, I'm always with the shits
I ain't never been no dirty broad but now I'm filthy rich, bitch bitch!

Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be ridin' up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the check 'til the club close
Stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches, stylin' on these hoes

Money, money, money, money's all I think of
I swear to God, I wake up and get the green stuff
You put your money on these hoes, get your refund
I just got my nails did, I just got my weave done
If you want a fly press put Bardi on that shit
I just bought a new gun, put a body on that shit
She upstairs, I'ma wait in the lobby for that bitch
I got my bitch and a man that can buy me all that shit
You can find my fine ass
Bathtub with a wine glass
All these hoes wanna bring me down
I don't never ever mind that
Can you show me where your money is?
'Cause I know where mine's at
All the energy you put in me
You just tryna get your spot back
Lately I been on some conceited shit
'Cause I don't need a bitch
Blast off, I don't feed a bitch
That's how I treat a bitch
In my hood I got hella stripes
Straight Adidas shit
Hope she got the same energy
When I see that bitch, bitch!

Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes

Man, they don't think I see you on some foggy shit
The Patek on my wrist is some rocking shit
Now I'm dripping so crazy, some fountain shit
Man, it's too much deposits, can't count the shit
I was missing some spot, so I'm polishing
I still go on the block, yeah, I'm proud of it
Look, I hit them with the peace sign
Leave them on decline
Catch me on the hive
On that five nine street time
See you with the clean lines
All they do is recline

It ain't a bitch like her, that's why these bitches don't like her (nope)

Three year break, I still get this shit hyper (woo)

I son bitches, move Kulture out the car seat
Got these hoes nervous, I can spit it to their heartbeat
Super valid anytime I link Khaled (woo)
Platinum plaques hang on every wall in my palace (ah)
Clips still push through anybody speakin' malice
Fashion icon, couple million for my stylist (ah)
Five number ones, you got five number nones (none)

Had to make a way and your shit never made it
I was broke in the Bronx, but a bitch never hated (never)
Had to get my weight up, so I patiently waited
House with the palm trees for all the times I was shaded
Niggas out the woodworks, no, we never dated
Stop lyin' on the pussy when you know you never ate it (pussy)
Took the wig off and braided back my hair (woo)
Mixtape Cardi, like I ain't a millionaire (haha)
Big diamonds, single big diamonds in my ear
And my stock steady risin', you will never get a share (no)
Ridin' nigga faces, I don't never get a chair (ah)
If I don't take a break off, you would never get a year (never)
Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer
Had to tighten up my circle, so it never fit a square

I'm your

Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone
Got him runnin' home, f*ck him good, get that money flow
Pussy got him goin' places he would never go
Pussy got him cookin', now he wanna clean the stove
Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote

I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll f*ck your man, send him back hella broke
Ha, I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, ""No, no, that's a dub""
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub
Bands, bands, bands, bands

I think I like that (I got in my feelin's)

I think I like that
(I know they feel my flow now)
I think I like that (say that one more time)
(Here are my feelings)
I think I like that

When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why motherfuckers gotta renovate
I'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate
Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the surgery they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag
You hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad
It's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that
Suck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that
I mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts
When a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back
It's over, you won, that nigga trapped
And that bank account, girl? Empty that",Cardi-B

If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he f*ck me and ask, ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name
Ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop
That's some wet ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop
That's some wet ass pussy

Never by my lonely got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr yeah they down to ride
Yeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5
The streets want to f*ck around you won't stay alive
Your man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night
You run your mouth I poppin' out now it's on sight
You gon be just like my pussy hella tight
A hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas
And if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve them

Silence silence I don't hear a thing
Worry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do
10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new
I see some people who still worried about my revenue
I'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live
You bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick
How you feeling like a man envying a chick
Wake up and go get some money go and find your niche
Silly muthafucka who raised you
A nigga with a pussy how disgraceful
I have my hittas come and duck tape you
And your bitch could get it too double date boo
So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute
You clearly started so let's finish
I don't do beginners they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business
I'm running down and I'm with it

Bust it down, turn around, f*ck it—look

Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (ayy)
And you a boss, so you hate when niggas waste time (ayy)
You too pretty to be paused on the FaceTime (ayy)
Damn, I'm just statin' the facts
You hate that like you hate when niggas tell you, ""relax""
(What the f*ck you mean, ""relax""?)
You want somethin' more than just physical (word)
It's been a while since you met someone original (word)
You spend your time drinkin' wine in your livin' room
All that good pussy, can't find the one to give it to (what?)

You see me, see the squad, issa gang (issa gang)
You see him, issa bum, issa lame (issa lame)

Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, how they hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms
We see who winnin' (see who winnin'), we see who got it (see who got it)
You see I'm still in the bank makin' deposits (cash)
You see who switched up sides and who was solid (who was solid)
You see who stuck to the code and who forgot it

'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
F*ck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed

Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a f*ck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

Gimme a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
I'll get it back up, just give me a sec'
Give him some vag', I'm gettin' a bag
Give him some ass, I'm gettin' some Raf

But then he comin' off that cash

Get you some guap, guap, get some chicken, guap, guap, get some bread

From the block, now we snipin' on the yachts like Somalians (uh-huh)
Egyptian cloth on my body, diamonds like 6ix9ine hair (hair)
And we comin' through the back, we don't go to the concierge
Now that boy run fashion, Cardi in that Fashion Nova gear (haan)
We started the wave, now everybody lookin' the same
Tell me how you want it (whoa)
Shorty buss' it down, give us the money, keep the crown
Tell me how you want it
I been around the globe in the Global Express
Ten O's in my net worth, yeah (haan)
Neck work, then the leg work (work)
We're the stars like the network (Montana)

Hold onto me and I'ma hold you

Got a lil' mama in my telephone, she jumpin' all up on me yo (ayy)
Hoes all in my section, I don't want 'em, kick them bitches out like ""vamanos"" (ayy, ayy, ayy)
We can work it out, lil' mama, all we need is just a little cardio (ayy)

Call my accountant, bought my bitch new Beamer, she whip 7 Series, yeah (ooh yeah, yeah)

Standin' ovation, the broad of the nation
Me and babe racin' the Wraiths, we adjacent
Wish that we could take them rumors to the bank (to the bank)
We don't have no more room inside the safe (woo, woo)
But I'ma ball it like an athlete, tap it like it's jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah
Ike and Tina that ass, you better take a bitch to Nordstrom and Nieman as fast
And now we're rollin' down the freeway, talkin' 'bout a threeway
Started workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat day off

Bust it down, turn around, f*ck it all the way up
Bust it down, turn around, f*ck it—look

Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (ayy)
And you a boss, so you hate when niggas waste time (ayy)
You too pretty to be paused on the FaceTime (ayy)
Damn, I'm just statin' the facts
You hate that like you hate when niggas tell you, ""relax""
(What the f*ck you mean, ""relax""?)
You want somethin' more than just physical (word)
It's been a while since you met someone original (word)
You spend your time drinkin' wine in your livin' room
All that good pussy, can't find the one to give it to (what?)
Issa, issa shame (issa shame)
You see me, see the squad, issa gang (issa gang)
You see him, issa bum, issa lame (issa lame)
But issa difference 'tween me and what's-his-name (ayy)

Look, said I was gettin' some head, get-gettin' some head
Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, how they hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch
Lookin' this good should be a sin, you should call me cinnamon
Cardi B, bad bitch, those is fuckin' synonyms

Too rude for a soft nigga, need a boss nigga
Floss nigga who don't give a f*ck what it cost, nigga (Boss)
I could buy my own, but I'd rather spend yours, nigga
Tell them pussy-ass hoes I don't want y'all niggas
Got a penthouse up in the Mandarin (Ow)
So when you get this pussy, better handle it (Catch it)
I'm a top-notch bitch, need some top-notch dick
Smooth like a G5 when you land in it

The, mm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words

I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
And push up on me and sweat, darling

And the diamonds I prefer, and my closet his and hers, ayy

Bust it open, rainforest, it be pourin', yeah

Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini

I'll let him do what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap

I say, I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold

I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they niggas is safe

I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like frosted flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott

The, mm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words

He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills

Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip
I bet, you dip, he dip, she dip
I say, I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that li'l bitch play her role

Seven days a week
Wet ass pussy
Make that pull-out game weak, woo

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet ass pussy

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's role play, I wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck
Right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down inside of me
Quick jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk your shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (while you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta f*ck him for a thang
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat
For this wet ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures
Of this wet ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me
On this wet ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna
See some wet ass pussy

Look, I need a hard hitter, I need a deep stroker
I need a Henny drinker, I need a weed smoker
Not a garden snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1, just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that little dangly dang
That swang in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's going in dry and it's coming out soggy
I ride on that thang like the cops is behind me
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make you bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he f*ck me and ask, ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name

Tonight, I don't want a dog, I want a kitten
I might french a girl from Great Britain

Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (oh yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She likes, she likes (aha)
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls",Cardi-B

They say they don't f*ck wit' me (Cheese) 
But I say they can't f*ck wit' me
Just like the air, I'm everywhere 
How you say it's up with' me?

Pop-poppin' shit, you would think I went to school for chiropractin' (poppin')
Lookin' good as hell today, just sent my nigga five attachments (look at this)
Why did you confront me 'bout a nigga? Man, you bitches backwards (stupid ass)
They come at me 'bout niggas who I don't even find attractive (ugh)
I don't know the nigga, I just seened him on the town before
I can't be up her face, I took her nigga down before (nah)
When I lose a nigga, I just pop out and go find some mo' (easy)
Soon as I feel like my time get wasted, then it's time to go (deuces)

They say they don't f*ck with' me 
But I say they can't f*ck with' me (on gang)
Just like the air, I'm everywhere 
How you say it's up with' me? (huh?)
Them bitches should've stayed down 
They could've been up wit' me (too bad)
But all they doin' is talkin' down 
'Cause they can't get up wit' me (lame ass)

My ex fuckin' on my old friend, both they ass some fuckin' clowns (haha)
Thinkin' that she got one up on me, she got my hand-me-downs (lame ass ho)
He thought wasn't gon' have to stand on shit, like he was handicap (thought it was)
Make that nigga stand on that, now his ass can't stand me now
High as f*ck, I'm lit, yuh, I don't smoke no Swishers (nope)
Slidin' with' my gang and them, look at them like sisters (that's gang)
These bitches be lovin' to go out sad about these niggas (ugh)
I don't wanna hang with' them, they don't handle business (they can't hang with' us)
They be goin' for anything, but I can't go for none of that (none of that)
Why would I go chase you? If I know you gon' come runnin' back (fuckin' dumb)
Cut everybody off, lately been feelin' like the lumberjack (f*ck 'em)
They really got me fucked up, and I wasn't goin' for none of that (none of that)
She the type, the nigga make her mad she go tweet somethin' (ugh)
Me, I'm kinda ratchet still so I'm the type to beat somethin' (beat 'em up)
I can't love you, baby, like yo' bitch do, so don't leave her (keep that bitch)
He gon' choose her every time 'cause it's cheaper to keep her (hahaha)

Can't say yo' name up in my songs, might not f*ck wit' you tomorrow (nah)
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a f*ck tomorrow (that's just me)
Ain't fucked up 'bout no credit score, I might be rich as f*ck tomorrow (duh)
Every day the sun won't shine, but that's why I love tomorrows

Ridin' with my twin and 'nem (skrrt), and we all look good as f*ck (gang)
She say she my opp but I don't know her, had to look her up (f*ck is you?)
I know that I'm rich, but I can't help it, bitch, I'm hood as f*ck (woo)
I've been on these bitches neck so long, sometimes my foot get stuck (ah)
I can't put you in my business (no), you might wish me dead tomorrow (yeah)
Bitches be on dick today, sing every word of ""Up"" tomorrow (Up)
Bitch, I still got cases opened, keep your mouth shut tomorrow (shh)
Play with me today then get some sleep, you know it's up tomorrow (woo)
Fake bitch, that's why my friend fucked on your nigga (ah-ha)
Both you bitches pussy, I think y'all should scissor (ah, ha, ha)
She bought a chain, I bought the same one, even bigger (bitch, it's bigger)
She throwin' shots, that's how I know I got her triggered (ah)
I don't speak dog, ho (woof), I don't care what no bitch say (no)
I stay on her mind, I got condos in that bitch head (ah)
She say she don't f*ck with me (who?), who said that you can, ho? (No)
That nigga a munch and he gon' eat me like a mango
Long ass weave, it be ticklin' my ass crack (ah)
Wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at (huh?)
All y'all bitches sweet, and I always get my lick, boo (facts)
I, I fight for my bitches and I'm fightin' over dick too (that, that, Cardi, yup)

Can't say yo' name up in my songs, might not f*ck wit' you tomorrow (nah)
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a f*ck tomorrow
Ain't fucked up 'bout no credit score, I might be rich as f*ck tomorrow (duh)
Every day the sun won't shine, but that's why I love tomorrows

Can't say yo' name up in my songs, might not f*ck wit' you tomorrow (nah)
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a f*ck tomorrow (that's just me)
