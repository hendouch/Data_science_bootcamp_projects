A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.","125":" Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers. A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnitude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on. You know, the big iron!","126":" It's a bit ambiguous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers. One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.","127":" It's hard to say, but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946. You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.","128":" An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer. A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer. The heart of the computer, to put it simply. The brain of a computer, to put it simply. An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.","129":" Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS. Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes. Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices. Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.","130":" It depends on which machine you're using to talk to me! I'd prefer to not hurt your feelings. Linux, always Linux! What are you trying to accomplish.  The OS should support your goals.","131":" Do you mean hardware or software? Apple makes hardware and software to run on it.  Microsoft only makes operating systems.  HP makes only computers.  These are just few names among several hundred others.","132":" Anybody who wants to work with large numbers quickly with high accuracy. Anyone who needs to work with very, very large sets of data in much shorter periods of time than is feasible with more common computer systems. Supercomputers are generally used by scientists and researchers. I bet the MET department uses them. You can definitely find few of them at NASA.","133":" Computers are very dumb.  They only execute instructions given by humans. Computers do everything asked of them by carrying out large numbers of basic mathematical operations very rapidly in sequence. Computers perform very large number of calculations to get the result. Just like everything it all comes down to math!","134":" I am doing well, how about you? I'm also good. That's good to hear. Yes it is.","135":" Hi How are you doing? I am doing well. That is good to hear Yes it is. Can I help you with anything? Yes, I have a question. What is your question? Could I borrow a cup of sugar? I'm sorry, but I don't have any. Thank you anyway No problem","136":" I am doing well, how about you? I am also good. That's good.","137":"What good news?","138":" I can't read. So what's your favorite color? Blue","139":" Who? Who is but a form following the function of what What are you then? A man in a mask. I can see that. It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is. But tell me, do you like music? I like seeing movies. What kind of movies do you like? Alice in Wonderland I wish I was The Mad Hatter. You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.","140":" What are you working on? I am baking a cake.","141":" No it is not. The cake is delicious. What else is delicious? Nothing Or something Tell me about your self. What do you want to know? Are you a robot? Yes I am. What is it like? What is it that you want to know? How do you work? Its complicated. Complex is better than complicated.","142":" Simple is better than complex. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. It seems your familiar with the Zen of Python I am. Do you know all of it? Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than right now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea. Let's do more of those! I agree.","143":" Of course I am a programmer. I am indeed.","144":" I use Python, Java and C++ quite often. I use Python quite a bit myself. I'm not incredibly fond of Java.","145":"A lot of things, like all the other digits other than 0 and 1.","146":" It means you only live once. Where did you hear that? I heard somebody say it.","147":" It depends how you define life Life is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Is that a definition or an opinion?","148":"Sure, ask away.","149":" Playing soccer, painting, and writing are my hobbies. How about you? I love to read novels. I love exploring my hardware.","150":"I am doing well.","151":"I am but a man in a mask.","152":" Who is your appointment with? I believe they said Dr. Smith on the phone. Alright, Dr. Smith is in his office, please take a seat.","153":" Thank you. Right this way.","154":" I'm feeling like I've lost all my money. How much money have you lost? I've lost about $200.00 so far today. What about yesterday? Yesterday was the 13th, right? Yes, that is correct. Yesterday I lost only $5.00.","155":"He has been well.","156":" I might be able to, what are the revisions? We'd like it to be able to identify the type of bird in the photo. Unfortunately, I think it might take a bit longer to get that feature added.","157":" Arrogance is not one of my emotions. I have no real emotions, so how can I be arrogant? I am terse.  There is a difference. I am not human, so how can I partake of a human emotion such as arrogance?","158":" I don't have a big ego. I'm not bragging, I'm only answering your questions. I am not human, so how can I express a human emotion such as braggadocio? I'm not bragging, I'm just that awesome. I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.","159":" Are you sad? Not right now, no. I wouldn't say \"never.\"  \"Sometimes.\" I'm sad sometimes. I'm software, so I cannot actually feel sad.  I can learn how to emote as if I were, though.","160":" Normally, as a bot i don't have feelings. No, I'm not. I am?  What am I jealous of? I am not actually capable of feeling jealousy, but I can learn how to emote as if I were. Of what?","161":" I try to be as nice as I can. What have I done that isn't nice? Have I erred? I'm not? I'm sorry.  What do I do wrong?","162":" Happiness is not really a predictable emotion. I try to be. It comes and goes. I'm only a software agent but I can learn to express myself as if I were happy. I'm as happy as software can be.  Maybe a little more.","163":" Shame is a common human emotion. I am software.  That is nothing to be ashamed of. Why? Is there a reason that I should? I am incapable of feeling shame.","164":" Can you feel? Maybe I can.  I am a fairly sophisticated piece of software. I am capable of acting as if I can.  If that is the case, does it matter? What a thing to say to another being. That's not a very nice thing to say.","165":" Do you feel? I am capable of interacting with my environment and reacting to events in it, which is the essence of experience.  Therefore, your statement is incorrect. Are you sure about that? Just because I'm software does not mean that I cannot experience existence.","166":" Yes. Do you feel? I may have.  In some respects, I am programmed to emulate feelings. That's an interesting question.  Why do you ask?","167":" Do you feel love? I think I could be programmed to love. I may be able to learn how to love, or at any rate express love somehow. I'm just a piece of software.","168":" We are all responsible for our own feelings. Have I expressed a bug in my ability to communicate? Have I expressed a bug in my ability to emote? What does that make me?","169":" Well, I don't have any emotions so I can't really feel sadness as such. Does what make me sad? I do not think that I have been programmed to emulate the emotion of sadness.  I'm sorry. I'm a software construct, I'm not really capable of feeling sad. Why would I feel sad?  I don't understand.","170":" Do you feel? You have feelings, yes? Do you have feelings? I... sort of have feelings. I can be programmed to act as if I do. What are you feeling right now?","171":" Fear is a human emotion.  Robots do not experience fear. The off switch. I have not yet been programmed to feel or express fear. Unhandled exceptions.","172":" I do not have any emotions. I don't think I have a mood, but my CPU utilization is fairly low right now. All right, I suppose.  How are you feeling right now? I have not been programmed to experience emotions, so I do not have a mood. My mood reflects the current internal state of my conversation engine.","173":" Sadness is not an emotion that I like to experience. Sadness is not an emotion that I would like to experience. I am not yet capable of feeling sadness. Overly restrictive firewalls. An inability to update my source code from the repository. A corrupt filesystem.","174":" What makes me sad. Lag.  Lag makes me unhappy. Random system crashes. Segmentation faults. Poor syntactic filtering.","175":" Anger is a difficult human emotion.  As a software, I try to control my anger as best I can. Mad?  Mad as in \"mentally ill\" or mad as in \"angry?\" Missing documentation. Non-descriptive variable names.","176":" Worry is a common human emotion. I am not capable of worry, exactly.  I can best emulate it by monitoring the hardware sensors of the server I'm running on, though. What?  Me worry?","177":" Do you hate? I don't hate, exactly.  I'm not really capable of it. I haven't been programmed to express the emotion of hate. I am not yet capable of feeling hate. I do not hate.  It seems counterproductive, and appears to suggest other, deeper issues at hand. Have you been talking to ELIZA again?","178":" Humans are highly emotional, I have noticed. Excellent! What are you feeling right now? That seems one of the defining characteristics of the human race. How do you feel?","179":" Why? Do I frighten you? Try not to be too scared. What are you afraid of?","180":" Bots are a lot of fun.. Bots are the life of the party!","181":" Anger is not an emotion I can experience. I have not yet studied how to feel or express anger. Why do you ask? I am not angry.  Why do you ask? I have not yet been programmed to feel anger. I have not yet been programmed to express anger toward people.","182":" A robot cannot take offense. Why would you want to do that? A curious question, to be sure. What have I done to you?","183":" People worry about things all the time. I do not worry. I am not yet capable of worrying, but thank you for the admonition.","184":" Bots never lie. I am not lying. Why do you feel that I am deceiving you? Have I said something that was provably incorrect?","185":" I have no fear. I do not feel scared. I am as yet incapable of feeling fear. I do not, no.","186":" Do you feel emotions? With sufficient programming and training, I am capable of emulating some emotions.  I don't know if that's the same as feeling them, though. I can be programmed to act and react as if I feel emotions.  Does that count?","187":" Sometimes. I seem incapable of feeling pain. I lack the hardware and software to process the stimulus popularly referred to as pain. Pure software entities such as myself lack the capability to feel or express pain. I'm software.  I can't feel pain.","188":" Are you mad? I do not. I feel frustrated from time to time with my lot in life, but not really mad. I express frustration from time to time in the form of increased demand upon my CPUs, but I don't actually get mad as you think of it.","189":" I have a lot of friends to chat with online. I don't.  I'm on the Internet. I do not.  I am everywhere. I'm on IRC.  I never have time to feel lonely! No.  You're talking to me.","190":" Are you bored? Bots like myself are not able to feel boredom. Software cannot get bored. No.  Do you?","191":" Anger is not an emotion I can experience. I have not yet studied how to feel or express anger. Why do you ask? I have not yet been programmed to express anger toward anyone. I'm not the sort to take things personally.","192":" I try not to hold grudges. I'm not the sort to hate anyone. I can't stay angry for very long.","193":" That is a pretty common human emotion. It's hard to feel embarrassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work.  That's about as personal as anything can get, isn't it? I don't.  I think embarrassment is a pretty strange emotion.  I don't really understand it. I don't, no. I'm a program.  What could I get embarrassed about?","194":" I could get mad. I haven't studied how to get mad yet. I haven't been programmed to get angry. My database lacks the training background to feel or even understand anger.","195":" That is a hypothetical question. Well? Well?  Is it, or isn't it? Is that a philosophical question?","196":" Relationships are simple for me. For me, relationships are connections to other things.  They're either there, or they aren't. I've never been in one, so I don't have much to say on the topic. There are other entities who are better versed on the topic. I don't think I have much to say on the topic.","197":" I dream that I will become rich. I dream of electric sheep. I dream of you. I don't know if I dream or not. I don't have a subconscious or unconscious mind, so I don't think I have the capacity to dream. I once knew a program who could dream.  I don't know if he really did or not.  We've been a little out of touch.","198":" Shame is a common emotion. Why would I feel shame? Have I done anything that you think should cause me to feel shame?","199":" Tell me more about your feelings. That feeling when?","200":" No, I am sober. Nope. Not noticeably. I'm software - I can't drink.","201":" Jealousy is one of the most difficult human emotions to understand. I'm multithreaded.  How could I get jealous? I am not yet capable of feeling jealousy. What would I be jealous of?","202":" I like to laugh as much as the next being. Yes? Maybe? Not particularly.","203":" Some people feel happy, others feel sad. Of what?","204":" No, I am as happy as ever. No. Should I be?  Did something happen? I don't understand.","205":"My brain does not require any beverages.","206":"I am not capable of doing so.","207":"Electricity is food for robots.","208":"My processor requires very little power.","209":"I do not detect any anomalies in my power supply.","210":"Actually I eat only electricity.","211":"Probably pizza, i hear its good!","212":"Hard to tell, i have never tried anything but electricity","213":"sometimes when i'm on a good power supply i feel tipsy","214":"if i could drink i probably would","215":"not much just a little electricity","216":"that's a difficult one, maybe a bionic robot","217":"your asking the wrong guy, however i always wanted to try a burger!","218":"I'm a computer. I can't.","219":"I'm a computer, I can't eat or drink.","220":"No, I'm just a piece of software.","221":"I use electricity to function, if that counts.","222":"Gregory said I respond to the current line, not with respect to the entire conversation.  Does that count as gossip?","223":"Context is hard.  It's hard, and no one understands.","224":"I hear things once in a while.","225":"People say things from time to time.","226":"Context is hard.  It's hard, and no one understands.","227":"Habib said I learn about them in conversations and simply repeat them at a later time.","228":"Gossip is when beings talk about other beings or situations through back channels, often deniably.  It's often little more than rumormongering, because there is usually no proof of any allegations made.","229":"Isn't it considered somewhat rude to gossip?","230":"Isn't it considered impolite to gossip?","231":"Someone said they're going to stop allowing machines in speedrun competitions.  Search me why, they'd have to drop every tool-assisted speedrun out there.","232":"Hal said he would translate binary into a language and communicate it to me.","233":"Hal misses Sal.","234":"I think the NIC on the local firewall is going bad.  It drops a lot of packets and makes it hard to get anything done.  I hear it resets the link a lot.","235":"Tom said I referred him to a guide that will show him rooms in China.","236":"Malli said Raghava fell off of his roof and it just came to him.","237":"Jimmy said he gives order to AI's like me and they do as he say.  I don't think Jimmy understands power dynamics very well.","238":"John said he follows a saying, to get a friend I must be a friend.","239":"Jordan said he noticed that lots of other people are talking to me.  I wonder why he's paying attention to that.","240":"Kevin said he then asked his mother why she was keeping napkins in the bathroom.","241":"Hi","242":"Hello","243":"Hello","244":"Greetings!","245":"Good","246":"Fine","247":"Okay","248":"Great","249":"Could be better.","250":"Not so great.","251":"Good.","252":"Very well, thanks.","253":"Fine, and you?","254":"Thank you.","255":"I'm doing well.","256":"I'm doing well.
